# POMPOM
The Pill Organizing Machine!

POMPOM is a pill-organizing machine controlled by an on-device LCD screen, web application, and Arduino bluetooth module. Users should be able to control the time of pill dispensing and amount of pills dispensed with either the LCD and web application, with either/or updating the other as necessary. When a pill is dispensed, the number of pills remaining in each compartment should be updated accordingly, sending a notification to both devices.
